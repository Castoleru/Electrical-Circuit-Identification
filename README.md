### Electrical-Circuit-Identification

## Intro

In this project I identified an electrical circuit which operates an brushless DC electric motor using its Input and Output data.In the first image we can see the BLDC motor and in the second image we can see de system model.

## Input and output data

In the next image we can see the ploted data which I used to generate an mathemathical model using ARX, ARMAX, IV and OE methods.
